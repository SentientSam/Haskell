# Haskell

This is a repo made for me to test and work on Haskell, a functional language.
Functional languages can so everything most of the popular languages can achieve, they just fall into a different niche.

#This link below is to install Haskell on your machine
https://www.haskell.org/platform/index.html#windows

You can compile Haskell code with the keyword ghc followed by filename

ex. ghc Sum.hs

If you are having any problems installing or running the file, try opening you command prompt/terminal in admin mode
I use VS Code, so I open Vs Code in admin mode and that works fine.
