# Haskell

Reference : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/haskell/haskell_functions.htm

This is a repo made for me to test and work on Haskell, a functional language.
Functional languages can so everything most of the popular languages can achieve, they just fall into a different niche.

# This link below is to install Haskell on your machine
https://www.haskell.org/platform/index.html#windows

You can compile Haskell code with the keyword ghc followed by filename

ex. ghc Sum.hs

Running this will create an exe, a .hi, and a .o file

If you are having any problems installing or running the file, try opening you command prompt/terminal in admin mode
I use VS Code, so I open Vs Code in admin mode and that works fine.

**Sum:** Returns the addition of 2 numbers \newline

**Fact:** Returns the factorial of a number

**Fact_Guard:** Returns the factorial of a number (using guards instead of pattern matching)
